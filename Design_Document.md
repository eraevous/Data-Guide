Design Document: Univariate and Whole-Dataset Level Profiles for EDA Module
________________________________________
Purpose
The Data Book (or Data Guide) module aims to create a reusable and modular Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework that generates comprehensive data profiles. By standardizing data profiling across projects, this module saves time, ensures consistency, and enhances stakeholder communication.
Key Objectives:
1.	Understanding the Dataset:
o	Summarize structure, types, and characteristics of the data.
2.	Identifying Potential Issues:
o	Detect missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3.	Stakeholder Communication:
o	Provide clear, interpretable insights for technical and non-technical audiences.
4.	Guidance for Downstream Tasks:
o	Assist in feature engineering, data cleaning, and modeling decisions.

Module Components
1. Dataset-Level Profiles
Purpose:
To summarize the overall structure and integrity of the dataset.
Steps:
1.	Dataset Metadata:
o	Row and column counts.
o	List of column names and data types.
2.	Duplicate Analysis:
o	Count and preview duplicate rows.
o	Identify perfectly correlated columns (redundant variables).
3.	Data Integrity:
o	Check for missing values in primary keys.
o	Perform cross-field consistency checks (e.g., logical relationships like Start Date ≤ End Date).
4.	Temporal Analysis (if applicable):
o	Earliest and latest timestamps.
o	Time span covered by the data.
o	Temporal gaps between records.
o	Trends (e.g., record counts by time intervals).
Outputs:
•	Summary statistics (e.g., row/column counts, duplicate and perfect correlations).
•	Temporal insights (e.g., coverage, gaps, trends).

2. Univariate Profiles
Purpose:
To generate detailed insights into each column, considering both string and numeric data types.
Steps:
String Columns:
1.	Basic Information:
o	Count of blanks (e.g., NA, NaN, empty strings).
o	Number of distinct values.
2.	Character Analysis:
o	Longest and shortest string lengths.
o	Average string length.
3.	Value Distributions:
o	Most and least common strings (with counts).
o	Top 5-10 most common strings.
Numeric Columns:
1.	Basic Information:
o	Count of blanks (e.g., NA, NaN, NULL).
o	Count and percentage of zero and negative values.
o	Count of integers vs. non-integers.
2.	Statistics:
o	Min, max, mean, median, standard deviation.
o	Percentiles (e.g., 5th, 33rd, 66th, 95th).
o	Skewness and kurtosis (with simple interpretations).
3.	Value Distributions:
o	Most and least common numeric values.
o	Top 5-10 most common numeric values.
4.	Quality Checks:
o	Identify invalid or placeholder patterns (e.g., 99999, test, TBD).
o	Histogram of missing or invalid values per column.
Outputs:
•	Summary tables with key metrics for each column.
•	Highlighted anomalies or irregularities.

3. Information Theory Metrics
Purpose:
To evaluate the "richness" and dominance of categorical variables, quantifying their informativeness.
Steps:
1.	Entropy:
o	Calculate Shannon entropy to measure diversity in categorical values.
2.	Dominance Analysis:
o	Compute the percentage of records covered by the top N categories.
Outputs:
•	Metrics for entropy and dominance.
•	Top N categories with counts.

Additional Considerations
Automation
•	Automatically generate documentation in Markdown, HTML, or CSV formats.
•	Include default visualizations for distributions:
o	Bar charts for categorical data.
o	Histograms and density plots for numeric data.
Extensibility
•	Use modular functions to allow easy integration of new metrics or visualizations.
•	Design with scalability in mind to handle large datasets efficiently.
Performance
•	Optimize loops and leverage vectorized operations in Pandas.
•	Consider sampling techniques for very large datasets to ensure responsiveness.

Feedback and Reasoning
Why Include Temporal Analysis?
Temporal data often underpins critical decisions, especially in industries like healthcare or finance. Highlighting trends, gaps, and seasonality prevents oversights in data-driven strategies.
Importance of Entropy and Dominance
Entropy and dominance metrics quantify the informativeness of categorical variables. For example, a column dominated by a single category is less valuable for modeling but might indicate an opportunity for data cleaning or feature engineering.
Why Modular Design?
Many EDA tasks are repetitive. Modularizing functions ensures reusability across projects, saving time and standardizing outputs for consistency.
Balancing Scope
By focusing on univariate and dataset-level analyses, the module remains manageable while covering essential insights. Delaying multivariate analysis avoids over-engineering and scope creep.
