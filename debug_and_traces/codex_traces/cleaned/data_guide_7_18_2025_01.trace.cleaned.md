## ðŸ§  Codex Reasoning Chain

### ðŸª„ Step 1

The repository here is currently in the process of reorganization. Currently, there are no .purpose files and most function calls are now broken. I'd like you to generate current .purpose files to beg ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 2

I'm checking the AGENTS.md file in the repo's root to follow its directions. ls ^C

---

### ðŸª„ Step 3

I'm checking the /workspace/Data-Guide directory to confirm the repository path. ^C AGENTS.md README.md purpose_files pyproject.toml src

---

### ðŸª„ Step 4

I'm checking AGENTS.md to see what instructions I need to follow. # ðŸ“œ AGENTS.md Â· Cognitive-Coupled Coding Protocol (Codex Edition) *Global rules, behavioral schema, and system ethos for AI coding age ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 5

Iâ€™ll look for AGENTS.md in the /workspace/Data-Guide directory or src folder. ./AGENTS.md

---

### ðŸª„ Step 6

I'll open the README to see if there are any additional test instructions. # Data-Guide Code and directions for generating a "Data Guide" - enhanced data dictionary and EDA

---

### ðŸª„ Step 7

I'll check pyproject.toml for any relevant tests or dependencies. [project] name = "data_guide" version = "0.0.1" description = "Accelerated and Augmented EDA" authors = [{ name = "Zach" }] dependenci ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 8

I need to look through the repository directories for any tests, just in case. .: AGENTS.md README.md purpose_files pyproject.toml src ./purpose_files: Design_Document.md purpose_template.md ./src: da ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 9

The repo includes modules like pipeline, data_profiler, and test files such as test_profiler.py. - @ai-path: <module.path.here> # e.g. core.memory - @ai-source-files: [<file1.py>, <file2.py>] # List o ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 10

The Data Book (or Data Guide) module aims to create a reusable and modular Explo ratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework that generates comprehensive data profiles. By standardizing data profiling across ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 11

I also need to make sure I include ast_deps.csv. cat: ast_deps.csv: No such file or directory

---

### ðŸª„ Step 12

I'll check both the root and purpose_files directories for the file.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 13

I didn't find ast_deps.csv. Maybe it's spelled with underscoresâ€”I'll search for any .csv files. It seems the ast_deps.csv is missing. I'll check the src directory for more info. data_pipeline etl-data ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 14

I'll open each file and check its content for better understanding. import pandas as pd import numpy as np from scipy.stats import entropy import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns import ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 15

The file got cut off, so I'll open the data pipeline modules for review. print(markdown_report) ipeline __init__.py data_pull.py md_to_html.py api_client.py data_transform.py pipeline.py bivariate_pro ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 16

I'll open 'src/pipeline.py' to understand the context for my task. import pandas as pd import os from profiler import DataProfiler from data_transform import DataTransform import sys def load_csv_file ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 17

Iâ€™ll open src/data_transform.py to check the data transformation logic. # print(csv_report) data_transform.py import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime class DataTransform: @staticmethod def v ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 18

I'm starting by opening the src/main_pipeline.py file to dive into the code. main_pipeline.py import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns from data_profiler import DataProfiler from data_transform impor ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 19

I'm starting with src/profiler_update.py to check out its contents. de7:/workspace/Data-Guide# sed -n '1,120p' src/profiler_update.py import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns impor ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 20

I need to generate .purpose files for modules following AGENTS instructions, including coordination, schema, and integration points.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 21

I'll look for any patterns in the design doc or repo regarding ".purpose.md" files.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 22

I'll create .purpose files for main modules like data_profiler.py, data_transform.py, and pipeline.py.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 23

The test file might not be valid. I'll try running pytest to confirm. ==================================== ERRORS ==================================== ____________________ ERROR collecting src/test_pr ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 24

I'll generate .purpose files for data_profiler.py, data_transform.py, and pipeline.py based on instructions.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 25

I'll check api_client.py in data_pipeline to decide if a .purpose file is needed. lient.py import requests import pickle import os import json import sys class APIClient: COOKIE_FILE = "session_cookie ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 26

I'll generate .purpose.md files for each major script, excluding duplicates, based on user input. # sed -n '1,120p' src/data_pipeline/config.py This file's empty, so I'll move on and open data_pipelin ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 27

I'll start by generating the .purpose file for DataProfiler based on the design doc. main() se.md <<'EOF' > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 28

Time to create the .purpose file for data_transform now! EOF' > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - output schema > # - coordination logic > # ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 29

I'll re-run the tests with pytest to check if pandas is causing failures. ==================================== ERRORS ==================================== ____________________ ERROR collecting src/tes ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 30

I'll check git status to add the new purpose files and commit the changes. ?? src/data_pipeline/api_client.purpose.md ?? src/data_pipeline/pipeline.purpose.md ?? src/data_profiler.purpose.md ?? src/da ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 31

I'm reviewing the current status once more to ensure everything is up to date. A src/data_pipeline/api_client.purpose.md A src/data_pipeline/pipeline.purpose.md A src/data_profiler.purpose.md A src/da ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 32

I'll start by gathering lines from the .purpose files to summarize the changes. e.md # @codex-role: architect # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: # - output schema # - coordina ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 33

I'll check the snippet in the data_pipeline/api_client to understand its purpose. ient.purpose.md # @codex-role: architect # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: # - output schema ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 34

I'll summarize the PR, noting the failing tests and missing pandas. Let's finalize it.
