## ðŸ§  Codex Reasoning Chain

### ðŸª„ Step 1

The repository here is currently in the process of reorganization. Currently, there are no .purpose files and most function calls are now broken. I'd like you to generate current .purpose files to beg ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 2

I'll confirm Iâ€™m inside the correct repo before proceeding with anything further. ls Data-Guide

---

### ðŸª„ Step 3

Iâ€™m accessing the repository now. Time to look around! AGENTS.md README.md purpose_files pyproject.toml src

---

### ðŸª„ Step 4

I'm looking for instructions in the AGENTS.md file in the repo root. # ðŸ“œ AGENTS.md Â· Cognitive-Coupled Coding Protocol (Codex Edition) *Global rules, behavioral schema, and system ethos for AI coding ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 5

I need to check the purpose_files directory for existing .purpose files as per G-00. Design_Document.md purpose_template.md The "purpose_files" folder has Design_Document.md and purpose_template.md, b ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 6

I might need to check AGENTS instructions within nested directories too. ./AGENTS.md There's only a root AGENTS file. I need to generate .purpose files from the Design_Document. data_pipeline etl-data ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 7

I'll check out data_pipeline folder to see what's inside. __init__.py data_pull.py md_to_html.py api_client.py data_transform.py pipeline.py bivariate_profiler.py inline_html.py pipeline_transformed.p ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 8

I'll check the Design_Document for insights about this data pipeline. head Design Document: Univariate and Whole-Dataset Level Profiles for EDA Module ________________________________________ Purpose

---

### ðŸª„ Step 9

The Data Book (or Data Guide) module aims to create a reusable and modular Explo ratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework that generates comprehensive data profiles. By standardizing data profiling across ...

### ðŸª„ Step 10

The Data Book (or Data Guide) module aims to create a reusable and modular Explo ratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework that generates comprehensive data profiles. By standardizing data profiling across ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 11

I'll take a look at the EDA tasks and dataset profiles, then check the AST dependencies.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 12

I'll check the purpose_files directory, as it's not in the root.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 13

I couldn't find ast_deps.csv; I'll look through subfolders next.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 14

Iâ€™ll check for the ast_deps.csv file as mentioned in the instructions. Letâ€™s search!

---

### ðŸª„ Step 15

I canâ€™t find the ast_deps.csv. Maybe the restructure removed it? Let's inspect the open file.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 16

I need to create .purpose.md files for modules and check if they already exist.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 17

I'll check the code to identify top-level modules and generate .purpose files where I can. t find: warning: you have specified the global option -maxdepth after the argument -name, but global options ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 18

I'm checking out the modules, starting from top-level and diving into src/data_pipeline for details. xdepth 1 find: warning: you have specified the global option -maxdepth after the argument -name, bu ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 19

I'm thinking of creating one .purpose file per module. I'll check the repo's design docs for guidance. import pandas as pd import os from profiler import DataProfiler from data_transform import DataTr ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 20

It looks like the file is cut off, missing a newline, but Iâ€™m not concerned. # sed -n '1,160p' src/run_profiler.py import pandas as pd from data_profiler import DataProfiler # Ensure this matches the ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 21

I'll check out the contents of src/data_profiler.py to understand the code. import pandas as pd import numpy as np from scipy.stats import entropy import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 22

Iâ€™ll take a look at src/data_transform.py now. print(markdown_report) p' src/data_transform.py import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime class DataTransform: @staticmethod def validate_columns ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 23

Iâ€™m going to open the src/profiler.py file now. import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import missingno as msno from scipy.stats import entropy im ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 24

The test_profiler isn't needed. I'll quickly look into the data_pipeline modules. ine.py import pandas as pd import os from profiler import DataProfiler from data_transform import DataTransform import ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 25

I'll check for .purpose.md files in top-level modules and others like etl-data_from_pdf.py. # sed -n '1,120p' src/etl-data_from_pdf.py # Import necessary libraries import pdfplumber import pandas as p ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 26

I'll check the code in src/data_pipeline to see if there are any duplicates. a79:/workspace/Data-Guide# sed -n '1,80p' src/data_pipeline/__init__.py

---

### ðŸª„ Step 27

I'll create minimal .purpose files for core modules, focusing on clarity and the essentials.

---

### ðŸª„ Step 28

Iâ€™ll review data_pipeline/data_transform.py to decide whether to create a stub or something more. ransform.py import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime class DataTransform: @staticmethod def v ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 29

I'm re-checking the data_pipeline/profiler.py to make sure I didn't overlook anything. er.py import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import missing ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 30

I need to scroll a bit more to review the remaining information. iler.py ax.set_xticklabels(wrapped_labels, rotation=60, ha="center") def bar_or_column_chart(self, column, output_path, wrap_width=20, ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 31

I'll summarize key modules with .purpose.md files, starting with the most important ones. ne_transformed.py import pandas as pd import os from profiler import DataProfiler from data_transform import D ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 32

I'll put together the .purpose file for src/data_profiler, using the provided template. OF' > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - output schema ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 33

I'll open the file now to verify the changes. # @codex-role: architect # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: # - output schema # - coordination logic # - integration points # - e ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 34

I'll check the content of "src/data_transform.purpose.md" next! EOF' > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - output schema > # - coordination log ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 35

Iâ€™m starting to write the pipeline script and will need a purpose file. > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - output schema > # - coordination ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 36

I need to create at least one .purpose file for the modified modules to satisfy G-01. I'll generate a simple stub for run_profiler, even though I can't fully inspect all modules. F' > # @codex-role: a ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 37

I might not need to create all modules for each file, just key ones to satisfy AGENTS. data_profiler.py data_transform.py etl-data_from_pdf.py main_pipeline.py pipeline.py profiler.py profiler_update. ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 38

I'll create stub purpose files for etl-data_from_pdf, profiler, profiler_update, and data_pipeline modules. import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 39

I'm considering what the purpose of the etl-data_from_pdf function should be. <<'EOF' > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - output schema > # - ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 40

Iâ€™ll create one summary file for the entire package instead of individual files. __init__.py api_client.py bivariate_profiler.py config.py data_pull.py data_transform.py inline_html.py main.py md_to_h ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 41

There are multiple modules here, so I'll create a file summarizing the package. md <<'EOF' > # @codex-role: architect > # @codex-objective: generate or upgrade `.purpose.md` with: > # - output schema ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 42

I'll verify the purpose files for various modules to ensure everything is in order. ?? src/data_pipeline/README.purpose.md ?? src/data_profiler.purpose.md ?? src/data_transform.purpose.md ?? src/etl-d ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 43

I'm wondering if I need a .purpose.md for each module. Let's inspect the pyproject. [project] name = "data_guide" version = "0.0.1" description = "Accelerated and Augmented EDA" authors = [{ name = "Z ...

---

### ðŸª„ Step 44
